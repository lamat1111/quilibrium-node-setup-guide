# ðŸ”‘ Backup your private keys

After 30 minutes that then node has been running, it should have generated your keys and config files correctly. Use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or [Termius SFTP feature](https://support.termius.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402367330201-SFTP) to navigate to the `root/ceremonyclient/node/.config` folder.&#x20;

_You may have to enable visibility for hidden files in WinSCP if you don't see the .config folder._&#x20;

Download locally your `keys.yml` and `config.yml` files. Keep them safe and do not share them with anyone! It is a good idea to put them in an encrypted folder using a free tool such as [Encrypto](https://macpaw.com/encrypto)

If you need to migrate the node elsewhere, after installing the node from scratch you just need to put these 2 files in the `root/ceremonyclient/node/.config` folder (changing the ones automatically created by the node). Here is a quick way to do this.
