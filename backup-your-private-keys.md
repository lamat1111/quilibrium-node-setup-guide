# ðŸ”‘ Backup your private keys

After 30 minutes that then node has been running, it should have generated your keys and config files correctly. Use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or [Termius SFTP feature](https://support.termius.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402367330201-SFTP) to navigate to the `root/ceremonyclient/node/.config` folder.&#x20;

_You may have to enable visibility for hidden files in WinSCP if you don't see the .config folder._&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
After your node begins to work you need to keep updated backups of your whole `/ceremonyclient/node/.config` folder, because it contains all the files that hold your rewards.
{% endhint %}

<summary>.config folder contents (list)</summary>

* Config.yml\
  contains your private key as well as all the configs for your node. Your peerID and rewards are connected to the key in this file - DO NOT LOSE IT
* Keys.yml\
  contains other keys, but can be generated automatically by the node if you only have the Config.yml
* "Store" folder \
  contains all the files for the proofs generated by the node. Your rewards are connected to these proofs so you need to keep update backups of this folder
* MIGRATIONS\
  This file is necessary if you move the node to another machine
* REPAIR, RELEASE\_VERSION, SELF\_TEST\
  These files have various functions but do not need to be backed up

</details>

Personally and for maximum security, I back up my `keys.yml` and `config.yml` files locally, while I keep synced updated backups of all the other files remotely via StorJ. Some people just back up their entire .config folder, though.

Another thing I do, before shutting down a node, is I stop it and do a final full backup. This is because although you can back up your store folder while the node is running, the store file that is being written to won't be backed up, so you risk losing some rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to migrate the node elsewhere, after installing the new node from scratch, you will need to migrate your entire `root/ceremonyclient/node/.config` folder to your new node . See also [migrating-the-node-to-a-new-server.md](tutorials/migrating-the-node-to-a-new-server.md "mention")
