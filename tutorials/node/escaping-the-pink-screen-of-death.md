# ðŸ©· Escaping the "Pink Screen of Death"

Sometimes when updating the apps with the [node-auto-installer.md](../../node-auto-installer.md "mention"), or even manually, you will receive what I call the "Pink Screen of Death".

This is just a screen that asks you which services you want to restart, and usually clicking ENTER should suffice to move on. The issue isâ€¦ sometimes it doesn't work, and you get stuck here.

**To solve this issue, you may try these steps:**

1. Have you already tried pressing ENTER or ESC? If yes, then move on.
2. Have already tried pressing TAB to navigate to \<Cancel> and confirm with ENTER? If yes, then move on.
3. Log in to your server via another terminal window and reboot: `sudo reboot`
4. Run again the app update manually: `sudo apt -q update`
5. Install some extra apps: `sudo apt-get install git wget tmux tar -y`
6. If everything went smoothly up to here, you can either run again the  [node-auto-installer.md](../../node-auto-installer.md "mention")script (step 3), or you can proceed with the  [node-step-by-step-installation.md](node-step-by-step-installation.md "mention")where you left off.

_This process almost always solved the issue for me, I really hope you don't get stuck in the pink forever ;-)_
