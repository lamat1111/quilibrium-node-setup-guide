This is a tool that you can run in your terminal, and it will show a menu with the main options to install/update your node, as well as some useful shortcodes.

In my opinion, it is better to follow the [node-auto-installer.md](node-auto-installer.md "mention") guide if this is your first installation, but this tool may come in handy for managing your node later.

Simply run the below code in your terminal.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Follow the [safety-checks.md](safety-checks.md "mention") before running this script in your server
{% endhint %}

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
wget -O ~/qone.sh https://github.com/lamat1111/QuilibriumScripts/raw/main/qone.sh && chmod +x ~/qone.sh && ./qone.sh
```
{% endcode %}

After the first run, to run again the Q1 menu just run `./qone.sh`, it should also work by just typing `q1`  or `qone`.

***

**Old Q1 menu versions will automatically load every time you log in.**

If this is annoying to you, simply run the below command and the menu will not load by default anymore.

```bash
sed -i 's|^~/qone.sh|#&|' ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
