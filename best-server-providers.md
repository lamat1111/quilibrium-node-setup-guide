{% hint style="info" %}
This section is still under construction as I collect reviews from others. Thank you for using my referral links and supporting my work :-)

**Please avoid choosing a hosting provider that specifically does not support mining/crypto.**\
Some providers not only impose bans but often complain, negatively impacting Quilibrium reputation.  Always check their T\&Cs or ask in their support channels to avoid these issues.

## High quality

### [**Cherryservers** ](https://quilibrium.one/go/cherryservers)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️-  <mark style="color:green;">**\$$$**</mark>

**⚡️ Servers deployed instantly and fast support** \
😊 No KYC\
**💸 Pay with crypto** _(you need a Bitpay ID with KYC verification)_

They officially support Quilibrium and are recommended by Cassie, the project's founder. Probably the best product and support available at the moment. \
In both the Quilibrium Discord and Telegram communities, there is 'Lili,' she works for them and can provide advice and assistance. Their servers sell out fast these days, so there is a chance they will be out of stock, but you can join the waiting list. \
\
Here are some pre-configured server options: \
[Cloud VDS 4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/cloud\_vds\_4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E3-1240V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E3-1240V5](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v5?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1620V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1620v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1650V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1650V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE)

### [**Hostkey**](https://quilibrium.one/go/hostkey)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$**</mark>

**⚡️ Servers deployed instantly and fast support**\
☹️ May require you to KYC in some cases \
**💸 Pay with crypto** _(you need a Bitpay ID with KYC verification)_

**B**est value for money after Cherryservers (better to choose their dedicated "Bare Metal" servers, not the VPS).  You can pay with crypto :-)

***

### [Interserver](https://quilibrium.one/go/interserver)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed in 48 hours (they have some instant ones usually) and fast support**\
😊 No KYC\
**💸 Pay with crypto**

Quality at good prices.\
I have not personally tested them, but I have only heard good things.

### [**Latitude** ](https://quilibrium.one/go/latitude)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed instantly (only VDS) and fast support**\
😊 No KYC (but you need to connect a credit card)\
💰 **Pay with fiat only**

Expensive but very good quality.\
I have not personally tested them, but I have only heard good things.

<summary>Important notes on lower quality providers</summary>

Keep in mind that many VPS providers likely oversell their resources. When you purchase an 8-core VPS, it’s often less powerful than advertised. Typically, the cheaper the service, the more they oversell.

Generally, with these providers, it’s better to pay for no more than one month at a time, in case you need to switch.

And in most cases you will need to apply limits to your CPU usage to avoid being blocked.

**If you're using Contabo, be cautious.** \
They have previously blocked access to Quilibrium from their servers. Monitor your node log, and if you repeatedly see "peers: 0," it means you’re being blocked!

#### **Providers to avoid**

Alpenhost / Netcup / Hetzner\
\
_These providers either don't support Quilibrium, blockchain nodes in general, or have been reported giving issues to users running nodes._
