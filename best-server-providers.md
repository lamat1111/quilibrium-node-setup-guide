# 💻 Best server providers

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is bein updated every month as I collect reviews from others. Thank you for using my referral links and supporting my work :-)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please avoid choosing a hosting provider that specifically does not support mining/crypto.**\
Some providers not only impose bans but often complain, negatively impacting Quilibrium reputation.  Always check their T\&Cs or ask in their support channels to avoid these issues.

\
Alway rent dedicated servers (bare metal) or VDS. Do not rent VPS as they usually perform poorly.

## ⚡️ High quality

### [**Cherryservers** ](https://quilibrium.one/go/cherryservers)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️-  <mark style="color:green;">**\$$\$$**</mark>

**⚡️ Servers deployed instantly and fast support** \
😊 No KYC\
**💸 Pay with crypto**&#x20;

They officially support Quilibrium and are recommended by Cassie, the project's founder. \
Great quality and support, but at the moment they are too expensive for profitable mining (check the [.](./ "mention")for an estimate of current mining costs).\
In both the Quilibrium Discord and Telegram communities, there is 'Lili,' she works for them and can provide advice and assistance.\
\
Here are some pre-configured server options: \
[Cloud VDS 4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/cloud\_vds\_4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E3-1240V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E3-1240V5](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v5?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1620V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1620v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1650V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1650V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE)

### [**Hostkey**](https://quilibrium.one/go/hostkey)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$**</mark>

**⚡️ Servers deployed instantly and fast support**\
☹️ May require you to KYC in some cases \
**💸 Pay with crypto**

One of the best value for money right now.

***

### [ServerMania](https://quilibrium.one/go/servermania)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed in 8 to 24 hours and fast support**\
😊 No KYC\
**💸 Pay with BTC**

Great choice of servers with many specs.

***

### [Interserver](https://quilibrium.one/go/interserver)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed in 48 hours (they have some instant ones usually) and fast support**\
😊 No KYC\
**💸 Pay with crypto**

Quality at good prices.

***

### [**Vultric Hosting**](https://quilibrium.one/go/vultric)&#x20;

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed between 20 mins and 24 hours**\
😊 No KYC \
**💸 Pay with crypto (only BTC & BCH)**

Choose only their "dedicated servers". The more powerful ones only offer longer rentals (6/12 months), which I would not advise, but you can get a mid-range machine with monthly rental.

***

### [**Latitude** ](https://quilibrium.one/go/latitude)

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$\$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed instantly (only VDS) and fast support**\
😊 No KYC (but you need to connect a credit card)\
💰 **Pay with fiat only**

Very good quality,  but at the moment they are too expensive for profitable mining (check the [.](./ "mention")for an estimate of current mining costs).

***

## 😐 Lower quality

Do not rent their VPS, but only VDS or bare metal.

* [**Aeza**](https://quilibrium.one/go/aeza) (avoid their VPS as well as VDS, only use their dedicated servers)
* [**Contabo**](https://quilibrium.one/go/contabo)
* [**Blue VPS**](https://my.bluevps.com/aff.php?aff=713)[ ](https://quilibrium.one/go/bluevps)
* [**Hostinger**](https://quilibrium.one/go/hostinger)

## 💩 Providers to avoid

_These providers either don't support Quilibrium, blockchain nodes in general, or have been reported giving issues to users running nodes. Some are just scammy companies (cough... Space Hosting... cough)._
