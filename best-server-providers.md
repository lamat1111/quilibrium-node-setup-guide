## High quality

### [**Cherryservers**](https://iri.quest/cherryservers)&#x20;

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️-  <mark style="color:green;">**\$$$**</mark>

**⚡️ Servers deployed instantly and fast support** \
😊 No KYC\
**💸 Pay with crypto** _(you need a Bitpay ID with KYC verification)_

They officially support Quilibrium and are recommended by Cassie, the project's founder. Probably the best product and support available at the moment. \
In both the Quilibrium Discord and Telegram communities, there is 'Lili,' she works for them and can provide advice and assistance. Their servers sell out fast these days, so there is a chance they will be out of stock, but you can join the waiting list. \
\
Here are some pre-configured server options: \
[Cloud VDS 4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/cloud\_vds\_4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E3-1240V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E3-1240V5](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v5?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1620V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1620v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1650V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) /// [E5-1650V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE)

### [**Hostkey**](https://iri.quest/hostkey)&#x20;

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$**</mark>

**⚡️ Servers deployed instantly and fast support**\
☹️ May require you to KYC in some cases \
**💸 Pay with crypto** _(you need a Bitpay ID with KYC verification)_

**B**est value for money after Cherryservers (better to choose their dedicated "Bare Metal" servers, not the VPS).  You can pay with crypto :-)

### [**Aeza**](https://iri.quest/aeza)&#x20;

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed instantly (only VDS) and fast support**\
😊 No KYC \
**💸 Pay with crypto**

**B**etter to pick their cloud servers (VDS) with dedicated resources over the shared ones. On the other hand, their dedicated servers are the best choice, but they are more expensive and require 24 to 72 hours to be ready.\
Better to avoid their "Falkenstein location servers" as they are tunneled from Hetzner and can give network issues.

***

### [**Latitude**](https://iri.quest/latitude)&#x20;

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- <mark style="color:green;">**\$$$**</mark>

⚡️ **Servers deployed instantly (only VDS) and fast support**\
😊 No KYC (but you need to connect a credit card)\
💰 **Pay with fiat only**

Expensive but very good quality.\
I have not personally tested them, but I have only heard good things.

## Medium - Low quality

_Only use these VPS after Quilibrium version 1.4.18 to avoid issues. And read the notes below!_

* [**Contabo (any location outside of EU)**](https://iri.quest/contabo)&#x20;
* [**Hostinger**](https://iri.quest/hostinger)&#x20;
* [**Blue VPS**](https://iri.quest/bluevps)&#x20;
* [**Perfect Quality Hosting**](https://iri.quest/pqhosting)&#x20;

<summary>Important notes on lower quality providers</summary>

After version 1.4.18, the node's resource consumption will be significantly lower, allowing you to use more affordable services without the risk of being throttled by the provider. However, lower-spec nodes will also earn fewer rewards, so the choice is yours!

Keep in mind that many VPS providers likely oversell their resources. When you purchase an 8-core VPS, it’s often less powerful than advertised. Typically, the cheaper the service, the more they oversell.

Generally, with these providers, it’s better to pay for no more than one month at a time, in case you need to switch.

If you're using Contabo, be cautious. They have previously blocked access to Quilibrium from their servers. Monitor your node log, and if you repeatedly see "peers: 0," it means you’re being blocked. While this issue will likely be resolved after version 1.4.18, it's good to stay vigilant.
