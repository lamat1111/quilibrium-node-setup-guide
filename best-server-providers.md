### High quality \$$$

* [**Cherryservers**](https://iri.quest/cherryservers)\
  They officially support Quilibrium and are recommended by Cassie, the project's founder. Probably the best product and support available at the moment. In both the Quilibrium Discord and Telegram communities, there is 'Lili,' she works for them and can provide advice and assistance. Their servers sell out fast these days, so there is a chanche they will be out of stock, but you can join the waiting list. Here are some pre-configured server options: [Cloud VDS 4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/cloud\_vds\_4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) / [E3-1240V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) / [E3-1240V5](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e3\_1240v5?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) / [E5-1620V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1620v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) / [E5-1650V3](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v3?affiliate=CRXA3YWE) / [E5-1650V4](https://www.cherryservers.com/server-customizer/e5\_1650v4?affiliate=CRXA3YWE)
* [**Hostkey**](https://iri.quest/hostkey) - best value for money after Cherryservers (better to choose their Dedicated "Bare Metal" servers, bot the VPS)
* [**Latitude**](https://iri.quest/latitude)

### Medium quality \$$

* [**Blue VPS**](https://iri.quest/bluevps)
* [**Perfect Quality Hosting**](https://iri.quest/pqhosting)

### Low quality $

_Only use these VPS after Quilibrium version 1.4.18 to avoid issues. And read the notes below!_

* [Contabo (any location outside of EU)](https://iri.quest/contabo)
* [Hostinger](https://iri.quest/hostinger)

<summary>Important notes on low quality providers</summary>

_Both Contabo and Hostinger got a lot of hate from the community (and for good reasons). These cheap VPS will never perform great, but they do work. After mainnet (1.5) the node resource consumption will be much lower, and you will be able to use these cheaper services without the risk of being throttled by the provider. On the other hand... lower specs nodes will also earn fewer rewards. Your choice!_

_UPDATE: I have been testing Contabo for some time. Even locations outside of EU may give you issues. My take is that they are throttling the access to the network when in a VPS location there are too many nodes running. So you may have no issues for a while and then suddendly find out that your data flow has become very low. This is just my speculation, but if you choose to use the cheap Contabo servers... keep a close eye on them._

Contabo VPS (EU location) / Alpenhost / Netcup / Hetzner\

_These providers either don't support Quilibrium, blockchain nodes in general, or have been reported giving issues to users running nodes._
