description: Better Specs = More Rewards :-)

# ðŸ’» Hardware requirements

* **4 cores**
* **8 GB of RAM**
* **250 GB of storage (better SSD or NVMe)**
* **400 Mbit/s symmetric bandwidth (or 50 MB/s)**

Keep in mind that nodes with better specs will earn more rewards. The ratio for optimal rewards theoretically is be 1:2:4 (core:ram in GB:disk in GB). For instance 8 cores - 16 GB RAM - 32 GB storage. Your bandwidth will also matter.

VDS (Virtual Dedicated Servers) and Bare Metal (Physical dedicated Servers) are your best choice. Using a VPS (Virtual Private Server) may give you issues, as often the providers oversell the resources.\
That being said, using a VPS or a home machine may work just fine if you don't care about absolutely maximizing your rewards.

**Your CPU usage will be 80% > 100% all the time, while RAM usage will be quite low.**

If you choose to use a VPS; you will probably need to follow the guide  [limiting-your-vps-cpu-usage.md](tutorials/limiting-your-vps-cpu-usage.md "mention")in order to not be banned/throttled, since you be will on shared resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Outbound traffic after 2.0 should be up to 5 TB per month (raw approximation), depending on how you set the node._
