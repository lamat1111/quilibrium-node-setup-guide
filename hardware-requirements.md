# ðŸ’» Hardware requirements

* **4 cores CPU**
* **8 GB RAM**
* **250 GB SSD space**
* **400 Mbit/s symmetric bandwidth (or 50 MB/s)**

_Outbound traffic after 2.0 should be up to 5 TB per month (raw approximation), depending on how you set the node._

You can also refer to the [Quilibrium official docs](https://quilibrium.com/docs/noderunning).

Keep in mind that nodes with better specs will earn more rewards. The ratio for optimal rewards from 2.0 on theoretically will be 1:2:4 (core:ram in GB:disk in GB). Your bandwidth will also matter.

VDS (Virtual Dedicated Servers) and Bare Metal (Physical dedicated Servers) are your best choice. Using a VPS (Virtual Private Server) may give you issues, as often the providers oversell the resources.\
That being said, using a VPS or a home machine may work just fine if you don't care about absolutely maximizing your rewards.\
