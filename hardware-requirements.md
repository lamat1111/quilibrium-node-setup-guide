description: Better Specs = More Rewards :-)

# ðŸ’» Hardware requirements

* **8 vCPU\***
* **16 GB of RAM (better 32 GB)**
* **250 GB of storage (better SSD or NVMe)**
* **400 Mbit/s symmetric bandwidth (or 50 MB/s)**

Keep in mind that nodes with better specs will earn more rewards. The ratio for optimal rewards from 1.4.18 theoretically will be 1:2:4 (core:ram in GB:disk in GB). For instance 8 vCPU - 16 GB RAM - 32 GB storage. Your bandwidth will also matter.

VDS (Virtual Dedicated Servers) and Bare Metal (Physical dedicated Servers) are your best choice. Using a VPS (Virtual Private Server) may give you issues, as often the providers oversell the resources.\
That being said, using a VPS or a home machine may work just fine if you don't care about absolutely maximizing your rewards.

_Outbound traffic after 2.0 should be up to 5 TB per month (raw approximation), depending on how you set the node._

> _\*vCPU = CPU cores \* threads per core._ There are 2 threads per core in most of the current CPU architecture. So a server with 4 cores = 8 vCPU - [more info](https://www.howtouselinux.com/post/linux-command-check-cpu-cores#Methods\_to\_get\_the\_number\_of\_CPU\_cores\_in\_Linux)
