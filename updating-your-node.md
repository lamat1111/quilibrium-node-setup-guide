Stop your node service

Go to ceremonyclient folder

```bash
cd ~/ceremonyclient
```

Check whether some files are updated in the ceremonyclient git repo

```bash
git fetch origin
```

If there are files shown that are changed or different from your local copy, then run

```bash
git merge origin
```

Go to ceremonyclient/node folder

```bash
cd ~/ceremonyclient/node
```

Next, do a `go clean` command to clear all previous build files. Run:

```bash
GOEXPERIMENT=arenas go clean -v -n -a ./...
```

Next, remove the compiled go binary file `node`

```bash
rm /root/go/bin/node
ls /root/go/bin
```

The `ls` command should respond empty Next, make a new build compiled binary file `node`, run:

```bash
GOEXPERIMENT=arenas  go  install  ./...
```

Verify that the `node` binary is built again

```bash
ls /root/go/bin
```

Response should show `node`

Start your node via the service command

```bash
service ceremonyclient start
```
