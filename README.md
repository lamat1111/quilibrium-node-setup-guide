# ðŸ–– Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
The guide and the script are unofficial and have been created solely to support the project.
{% endhint %}

This guide contains all the info you need to install and manage a Quilibrium node, plus a special script to prepare your Ubuntu server and install the necessary applications.

All you need to do is follow the steps one by one. Required steps go up to the page [Backup your private keys](backup-your-private-keys.md), everything after that is optional.

SAFETY CONCERNS

_This_ [_auto-installer script_](node-auto-installer.md) _is simply packing all the necessary steps and the required applications in a one-click solution. It won't install your node (for now you will need to do it manually for security reasons), but it will prepare your server very quickly._&#x20;

_**You can inspect the source code**_ [_**here**_](https://github.com/lamat1111/Quilibrium-Node-Auto-Installer/blob/main/installer)_**.**_ \
_If you are not familiar with code, you can simply copy/paste the whole code in a chatbot such as ChatGPT (or any open-source alternative ;-) and ask them to explain it to you step by step._
