# 🖖 Introduction

{% hint style="success" %}
COMPATIBLE with Quilibrium 1.4.18
{% endhint %}

This guide has everything you need to set up and handle a Quilibrium node, plus a handy script to get your Ubuntu server ready and install all the apps you need.

I was once a total newbie too, so I made sure to keep this guide super noob-friendly. It's basically a collection of my own notes and trials from when I was figuring out Linux and managing my nodes.\

Just take it step by step. You only need to follow the required steps up to the  [Backup your private keys](backup-your-private-keys.md) page. Anything beyond that is optional.

DISCLAIMER

I can't take responsibility for what you do. The guide's content has been tested and shared as is, but if things go haywire and you accidentally delete your keys or mess up your server, well, that's on you! When in doubt, it's always a good idea to reach out for help in different groups. Oh, and don't forget to [backup your keys](backup-your-private-keys.md)! That way, even if something goes wrong, you can always reinstall your node from scratch.
