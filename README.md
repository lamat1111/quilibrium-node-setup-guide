description: All the info you need to install and manage a Quilibrium node
---

# ðŸ–– Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
The guide and the script are unofficial and have been created solely to support the project.
{% endhint %}

This guide has everything you need to set up and handle a Quilibrium node, plus a handy script to get your Ubuntu server ready and install all the apps you need.

I was once a total newbie too, so I made sure to keep this guide super noob-friendly. It's basically a collection of my own notes and trials from when I was figuring out Linux and managing my nodes.\
\
Just take it step by step. You only need to follow the required steps up to the  [Backup your private keys](backup-your-private-keys.md) page. Anything beyond that is optional.

SAFETY CONCERNS

_This_ [_auto-installer script_](archive/old-node-auto-installer.md) _is simply packing all the necessary steps and the required applications in a one-click solution. It won't install your node (for now you will need to do it manually for security reasons), but it will prepare your server very quickly._&#x20;

_**You can inspect the source code**_ [_**here**_](https://github.com/lamat1111/Quilibrium-Node-Auto-Installer/blob/main/installer)_**.**_ \
_If you are not familiar with code, you can simply copy/paste the whole code in a chatbot such as ChatGPT (or any open-source alternative ;-) and ask them to explain it to you step by step._

DISCLAIMER

I can't take responsibility for what you do. The guide's content has been tested and shared as is, but if things go haywire and you accidentally delete your keys or mess up your server, well, that's on you! When in doubt, it's always a good idea to reach out for help in different groups. Oh, and don't forget to [backup your keys](backup-your-private-keys.md)! That way, even if something goes wrong, you can always reinstall your node from scratch.
