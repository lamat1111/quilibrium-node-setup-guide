# üîÅ Set up the gRPC calls

After your node has been running for 30 minutes, run the below script to set up the gRPC calls.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Follow the_  [safety-checks.md](safety-checks.md "mention") before running this script in your server
{% endhint %}

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
wget --no-cache -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lamat1111/quilibriumscripts/master/tools/qnode_gRPC_calls_setup.sh | bash
```
{% endcode %}

If you have issues, try the manual method and also see: [#troubleshooting](set-up-the-grpc-calls.md#troubleshooting "mention")

### How to enable gRPC calls manually

This interface is read-only, but it does not require a password and doesn't have limits on the number of requests. To stay secure, you should only enable it if you control access with a firewall or only use it from the same computer (localhost). For example, if port 8337 is for gRPC calls, don't allow access to this port from the internet in your firewall. Instead, make sure gRPC calls are only made from your own computer.

Open the file `~/ceremonyclient/node/.config/config.yml` on your local pc using Termius SFTP feature or WinSCP.&#x20;

Or, if you want to edit the file via terminal, proceed like this:

Open the node `config.yml` file:

```sh
sudo nano ~/ceremonyclient/node/.config/config.yml
```

***

Find `listenMultiaddr: /ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/8336/quic` and replace it with:

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="lang-yaml"><strong>  listenMultiaddr: /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8336
</strong></code></pre>

There are two empty spaces before the line! If the line is already there, you don't need to make any change.

***

Find `listenGrpcMultiaddr: ""` (end of the file), and replace it with:

```yaml
listenGrpcMultiaddr: "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8337"
listenRESTMultiaddr: "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8338"
```

***

Find `engine:` (about the middle of the file), and paste right below it:

```yaml
 statsMultiaddr: "/dns/stats.quilibrium.com/tcp/443" 
```

It will look like this (notice the two empty spaces before the `statsMultiaddr` line):

```yaml
engine:
  statsMultiaddr: "/dns/stats.quilibrium.com/tcp/443"
```

***

Save the file. \
If you are on terminal you can save by pressing CTRL + X, then Y, then ENTER

### Troubleshooting

If after running the automatic script or settings things manually you have issues (for instance your node starting correctly), you may want to pull out a backup of your config.yml file and compare it with your current one. You can use [Diffinity](https://truehumandesign.se/s\_diffinity.php) to do this. &#x20;

Check for any strange differences, pieces of code you may have deleted or that the automatic script may have messed up.
